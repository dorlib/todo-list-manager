## TODO List Manager - For Managing And Tracking Your Daily Tasks

Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ </br>
This is a CLI for task managment using Go, Cobra cli & GORM!

The main purposes of this project are to gain more experience with golang and known & popular frameworks and technologies.
Also practise clean code, SOLID principles of golang and microservices architacture in golang.
In addition, gain experience of taste of what its like working with other team members on the same 
codebase, working with git and with the technologies github has to offer.

The CLI is written with the cobra framework for CLI creation, and GORM as ORM library and database connection, which is MySQL.
In the future, we will continue to extend the app and create more features, and even a UI is on our mind!

## Built With

- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) as CLI framework.
- [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) complete configuration solution for Go applications.
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/) as ORM library for Golang.
- [go-pretty](https://github.com/jedib0t/go-pretty/tree/main/table) for printing tables.
- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) as golang linter in order to preserve our code's quality.

## What the Application include?

The main entites in the app are : Tasks, Groups & Users.
As you can see in the welcome page of the app, the main "things" you can do are : managing and tracking, so Let's cover the main features!

1. Create Group - you can create a group in order to organize the task's of everyone in one place!
2. Create user - you can register in order to make yourself a user and login in order to access the team's task management system.
3. Manage users - give different premissions to different users.
4. Manage tasks - Create, update and task's content, update progress, and delete tasks (admin only).
5. Track tasks - print in tasks different variations and options to make efficient tracking.
6. Alert system - which will update the user who's the task is belong to by mail when deadline is coming near!
7. Define authorization - you can give admin access for some of the group's members inorder to have extra capabilities!
