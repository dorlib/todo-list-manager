Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹ </br>
This is my CLI for task managment using Go!

The CLI is wrriten with the cobra framework for CLI creation, and GORM as ORM library and database connection, which is MySQL.
In the future, we will continue to extend the app and create more features, and even a UI is on our mind!
